Wheel of fortune -like application written in Processing  

Will attempt to make releases.  

For now, make sure to have the segments in a textfile called "segments.txt" located in "C:\\code\\processing-4.  3\\Wheel\\", that is sadly currently hardcoded.  

If that same folder has a "center1.png", it will be a centerstone of the wheel.  

I *think* the wheel is currently fair, but would not guarantee it.
